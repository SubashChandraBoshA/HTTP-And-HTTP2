Internal Representation Of Objects In Java Script

Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types.

 	String
 	Number
 	Boolean
 	Null
 	Undefined
 	Symbol
 	Bigint

In the sense that these primitive data-types all hold a single value, depending on their types.

The complexity of objects means that they can contain both basic data types and reference data types.
A reference data type is an object. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. The location of the object's storage in memory is where the reference or pointer points to. The variables are not responsible for storing the value.

In JavaScript, objects can be described as a collection of related data, either primitive or reference types, in the form of 'key: value' pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are respectively called properties and methods in the context of an object. An object can be created with figure brackets {} with an optional list of properties. A property is a pair of keys and values, where the key is the property name and the value can be anything.
